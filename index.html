        <h2>About This Project</h2>
        <p class="about-text">
            The Khazefi project was born out of a desire to enhance communication and streamline the shopping experience for my father’s business. Growing up, I saw how much effort he put into building relationships with clients and how vital it was for him to have an efficient way to manage his business. Inspired by this, I embarked on creating a digital platform that would not only showcase his products but also improve client interactions. This project, initiated in early 2024, reflects my commitment to merging technology with personal passion.
